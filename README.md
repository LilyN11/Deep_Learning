# Deep_Learning
# minimum required project (MRP) (70%) for this group work consists of the following points
Formulate a specific weak supervision problem to address and justify its usefulness and feasibility.
• Discuss and justify which weakly-supervised segmentation algorithm to use.
o Use references and citations to support your choice.
• Optionally, motivate, identify and collect additional weakly-labelled or unlabelled data.
• Implement a weakly-supervised segmentation framework.
• Design and conduct experiments for network comparisons, at least:
o Compare the framework with baseline models trained using fully-supervised methods
